Each project is located in its own directory, and each directory contains a separate README file with information about the project, how to use it, and what the project does.

**Projects**

Here's a list of the projects included in this repository:

* Project 1: Diabetes Prediction


**Dependencies**

Most of the projects in this repository were built using Python, and many of them use popular Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

**Contributing**

If you have any suggestions or ideas for new projects, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request! I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to improve my skills.
