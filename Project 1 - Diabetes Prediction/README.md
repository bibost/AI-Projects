# Diabetes Prediction Project

This is a machine learning project that I completed in a Jupyter Notebook. The project involves predicting if someone does or does not have diabetes based on various health metrics. The notebook includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine. You can download and install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on their website: https://jupyter.org/install.

Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can open the project's Jupyter Notebook file and run each cell to see the results of the project.

Data

The data used in this project is located in this folder '\diabetes.csv'. The dataset includes various health metrics such as BMI, High Cholesterol etc..

Models

The Jupyter Notebook includes code for RandomForestRegression, CatBoost, LinearRegression, SGDClassifier, which were trained and evaluated on the data described above.

Results

The results of the machine learning model(s) are presented in the Jupyter Notebook, including F1 Score, Recall Score, Precision and Accuracy scores. The notebook also includes multiple plots that were used for data analysis.

Future Work

There are several ways that this project could be extended or improved in the future, by trying out other models or better tuning the current ones.
