# ISIC Skin Cancer Classification - Transfer Learning Project

This is a machine learning project that I completed in a Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab. The project involves classifying multiple categories of skin diseases.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine. You can download and install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on their website: https://jupyter.org/install.

Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can open the project's Jupyter Notebook file and run each cell to see the results of the project.

Data

The data used in this project can be downloaded using through Kaggle, everything needed for the download is included in the notebook itself.

Models

The Jupyter Notebook includes code for a Transfer Learning CNN model ResNet101 using Keras Functional API, trained on the above mentioned data.

Results

The results of the machine learning model(s) are presented in the Jupyter Notebook, including F1 Score, Recall Score, Precision and Accuracy scores. The notebook also includes multiple plots that were used for data analysis.

Future Work

There are several ways that this project could be extended or improved in the future, by trying out other models, better tuning the current one, training on more data, redefining the problem into a binary classification one.
